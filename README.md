## Description
Given that Paymerang makes payments on behalf of their clients, they like to be able to display payment details in a clear, and concise manner for their employees. For this assessment, I was given JSON data with multiple Payees, Payments, and Remittances and the only requirement was to show each object in a paged interface. As a USER/EMPLOYEE, I would like to be able to see this JSON data in an easily digestable format.  In order to accomplish this user story, I decided to build my application with React and incorporate kendo-react-ui to use their grid component. This application was created as an exercise and is NOT affliated with the official Paymerang brand.
